# Horiseon-Final

## Description

I was motivated to complete this project and gain an understanding on how to refactor code in a way that was easy to understand, especially for people coming back to read this code other than me.
I built this project to deliver the client with the best possible codebase I could create that followed accessibility standards, and could optimize their SEO.
The changes made to the existing code helped clean it up and make it easier to follow while reading.
I learned better semantic tags to use other than <div>, fixing broken links on a page, and how to consolidate CSS classes all while refactoring code.

## Installation

1. Install this project by going to the repository and cloning it on to your local drive.
2. Open in VS code.
3. Right click the index.html and open it in your default browser.
4. You should now be able to view the page.
